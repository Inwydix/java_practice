        /*Exercise 9. Write a program to read the amount and prices of various 
        products and calculate the final price of the shopping cart.
        The program must ask the user:
        Enter number of products:
        The user must enter a positive integer value. If the value is negative, 
        the question must be repeated until the user introduces a positive 
        integer value.
        Next, the program must ask the user:
        Enter value of the product:
        This number must be also a positive integer. If the value is negative, 
        the question must be repeated until the user introduces a positive 
        integer value.
        Introducing values for the shopping cart is finished when a 0 is 
        introduced as the answer of the first question. Next, the program must 
        print the total price of the cart. (The total price is the result of the 
        sum of the prices of each line of the shopping cart; the price of a line 
        is the result of the multiplication of the product price and the product 
        amount.)*/
